    <body><h2>Hi friend,</h2> 
        
        <p> Welcome To my website!!</p> <p> Here will I will show you my journey to become a web developer and designer and to inspire you 
        If I can do it at the age of 52 without any computer knowledge I am just an ordinary mom
        who works as a nanny/housekeeper if I can do it you can do it,</p>
        <p> All I have is the dream of not going to the old route of retirement 
        like the old folks we saw sitting on there chairs doing knitting and basically waiting for the day when our creator
        taking my precious life I want to create a different life path for retirement</p>
