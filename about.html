<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Jocelyn I am a mother of 3 grown up and a loving grandma to my 3precious grandkids 1 boy and 2 girls
  On this site, I will share with you the journey of my life from an ordinary mom who dreams of giving a better life for my kids and change our life
  lo become a housekeeper/nanny international and through ups and downs of my life and struggles that I've encountered in my life and become a web developer and an online entrepreneur.</p>

<p>I wanna inspire you to dream big and believe in yourself nobody will believe in your capability except you and you have to show them even no one in your family believes you can achieve anything and don't listen to anyone
  who never knows what you can able to do just follow your heart and your intuition you can reach whatever you want in life dream and believe.</p>

<p> Reaching your dream is not easy there be a lot of struggles and hardships but focus on your dream any trials and struggles are a part of success nobody will help you no amount of motivation from the outside world can help you you have to motivate yourself it will start
  inside you your biggest enemy is yourself you have to control your mind don't let your mind control you
  and don't let your feelings fool you that is your biggest enemy there are days that your mind tells you it's not worth it just sit down and watch TV/Netflix until you tired
  until you spend the rest of your day watching and doing something that's not aligned to your goal
  That's how you gonna be stuck.</p>
